= How to Create a Backup

The `Backup` object defines what and how to backup:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$tutorial/backup.yaml[]
----

Save the YAML above in a file named `backup.yaml` and use the `kubectl apply -f backup.yaml` command to deploy this configuration to your cluster.

TIP: To have backups run automatically at a regular interval look at xref:how-tos/schedules.adoc[schedules].

TIP: By default, all PVCs are backed up automatically. Adding the annotation `k8up.io/backup=false` to a PVC object will exclude it from all following backups. Alternatively, you can set the environment variable `BACKUP_SKIP_WITHOUT_ANNOTATION=true` if you want K8up to ignore objects without the annotation.

== Self-signed issuer and Mutual TLS

If you are using self-signed issuer or using mutual tls for authenticate client, you're able use a volume for mounting cert files into the backup object.

== Customize Pod Spec
You can override most of the fields in the podSpec for the backup jobs.

These are the fields you can't override:

* image
* command
* container name
* args

The podSpec has to be created via a separate object of the type `PodConfig`.
Any annotations and labels set on the `PodConfig` will also be applied to the pod.
Any fields on the `PodConfig` object has precedence over settings specified in the job.
For example, if the job has `podSecurityContext` set and the `PodConfig` has it set as well, then the setting from the `PodConfig` will override the setting in the job definition.
